    "A language model must be trained on the text, and in the case of a character-based language model, the input and output sequences must be characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of characters used as input will also define the number of characters that will need to be provided to the model in order to elicit the first predicted character.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the first character has been generated, it can be appended to the input sequence and used as input for the model to generate the next character.\n",

    "Longer sequences offer more context for the model to learn what character to output next but take longer to train and impose more burden on seeding the model when generating text.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use an arbitrary length of 10 characters for this model.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is not a lot of text, and 10 characters is a few words.\n",
